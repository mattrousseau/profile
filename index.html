              <h3>Ruby</h3>
              <p>Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.</p>

              <h3>HTML</h3>
              <p>If you're going to say that HTML is a programming language, then you might as well include things such as word documents, as they too are based on ML, or 'Markup Language'. So, no, HTML is a not a programming language. It is called "markup" for that reason.</p>

              <h3>Javascript</h3>
              <p>JavaScript was not developed at Sun Microsystems, the home of Java. JavaScript was developed at Netscape. It was originally called LiveScript, but that name wasn't confusing enough. The -Script suffix suggests that it is not a real programming language, that a scripting language is less than a programming language.</p>
